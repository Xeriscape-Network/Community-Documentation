As Minecraft modifications provide such a wide range of functionality, however, not all modifications are permitted to be used on our server. This guide outlines what types of modifications we do allow on the server. Preface Before using any modifications please be aware that all use of modifications on our server is at your own risk, including the ones we list as examples in this guide. We cannot review every version of every modification, and as such we cannot provide any guarantees of modifications being within our server rules. Any modifications you do install should always be obtained from the official source for that given modification, be that the creator\u2019s website, GitHub, CurseForge, or other profile (e.g. YouTube channel). Unofficial downloads from other sources may not behave as expected, which could include bugs or unadvertised features (which could result in punishments on our server), or can even be malicious in nature (e.g. viruses, spyware, etc.); A list of unsafe mod download websites can be found on the StopModReposts project website . What Is and Isn't Allowed Provided below is a list of the categories of modifications we permit on the server, along with an explanation of what each of these categories does and does not include and permit. If a modification does not fit into one of these categories, it should be assumed that it is disallowed by default. Performance Modifications Modifications that simply seek to improve the performance of the Minecraft client without making changes to the game itself, such as those which improve the FPS of the Minecraft client. Aesthetic Modifications Modifications that change only the look and feel of the game without modifying gameplay, such as standard shader modifications or even resource packs. These must not, however, change the properties of blocks (e.g. make non-transparent blocks transparent) or change the player\u2019s perspective (e.g. allowing them to see around or over objects they normally wouldn\u2019t be able to). Modifications that also alter the brightness and gamma settings of the Minecraft client fall into this category. Quality of Life Modifications Modifications which alter the look and feel of the in-game head-up display (HUD), without adding extra information which would normally be unavailable to the player. For example, HUDs adding armor and status effects, which are available to the player in their inventory screen, are permitted, while mini-maps, other player health/armor indicators, player distance/range, etc. are not. Modifications may also add additional features to the client that aid in inventory management, such as automatic organization. If a modification does not fit clearly into any of the allowed modification categories, it should be assumed that it is disallowed on the server. Allowed Client Modifications These are a small handful of modifications that you can use Telzenith MC. For the most part, these are cosmetic modifications or modifications which show limited amounts of additional information which should not give you an in-game advantage. OptiFine/Sodium (Client Optimization Mod) Client modifications which have the main goal of improving client FPS (Frames Per Second) by optimizing the way Minecraft operates and offering more customizable Video Settings. Shaders Mod, Sildurs Shaders, etc. (Shaders) Client modifications that change the visual appearance of the game to make it more aesthetically pleasing. Inventory Tweaks, Inventory Sorter, etc. (Inventory Management) Client modifications that allow for inventory management to be automated or made easier. Replay Mod (Gameplay Recorder)\u2020 Client modification which allows for the recording and playback of gameplay, while also allowing for the changing of perspective during playback (but not in live gameplay). Badlion Client, etc. (Clients/Mod Packs)\u2021 Minecraft client mods (sometimes made available as self-contained clients) which contain a variety of modifications grouped together into a single package are permitted, provided the included modifications are permitted on our server by themselves. F3+B (Minecraft Debugging) Built-in debug tool in the vanilla Minecraft client which shows entity (player, mob, etc) hitboxes. It is an official feature of Minecraft; Not a client modification Disallowed Client Modifications Although we do not provide a thorough list of disallowed modifications, a general rule of thumb is that any modification which provides any significant advantage over other players on the server is against our rules. Additionally, we do also note that anything which automates any player gameplay action is strictly disallowed, be those Minecraft modifications, external software, or hardware. This includes things such as (but not limited to) auto/burst clicking buttons or macros, auto-sprint, aim assists, and bots (such as Baritone). Finally, modifications that alter the way in which your Minecraft client interacts with and communicates with our server are also strictly disallowed, even if they otherwise fall into an allowed category. Please ensure that any modifications which are used are strictly client-side only, with them not changing or altering the behavior of the game. Hacked Clients Hacked clients (also commonly called cheat clients, utility mod, or even just 'client') that include modifications that provide players with unfair advantages over others on Telzenith are strictly prohibited. Players caught using any client deemed to be a hacked client, may be automatically banned by Hyperion; Players may use hacked clients outside of Telzenith, but while accessing the server, it is recommended to use a vanilla client instead to avoid a potential ban. Disclaimer The NGX Network does not endorse any of the mods named above, which are provided solely as examples of commonly used modifications on our server. The NGX Network nor any of its staff members are the developers of any of the named modifications unless explicitly noted, and we do not have control over those modifications. We are not responsible for the behavior or actions of any modification, which may be updated or changed (even automatically) at any time by their individual developers; Modifications are installed on a player\u2019s client at their own risk.

This can apply in situations like item/auction trades, item rentals/sharing, item repair, and combination services. In most situations, you may want to make an agreement before giving an item in a transaction. When trading an item, is it a good idea to thoroughly screenshot the process of giving an item to someone else. It may seem like overkill, but by having detailed screenshot evidence, you can protect yourself from false allegations of not following through with an agreement. Please read about proper evidence and how to take screenshots Don\u2019t Drop Items It is simply a bad idea to simply an item on the ground when giving it to someone, especially in a public space such as the world spawn or lobby. Another person entirely could come by and take the item before the other person has a chance to pick it up (this unknown person may even be invisible). Also, if the server crashes when you throw an item on the ground, the item may not be on the ground when you, and the person you are giving an item to, log back in. The SafeTrade System Telzenith makes use of the SafeTrade system that enables you to trade items and money with other users safely and securely. The SafeTrade system can be interacted with through the following: /trade Send a trade request to a player. /trade accept Accepts a pending trade request from another player. /trade deny Denies a pending trade request from another player. Benefits of SafeTrade Safe and convenient trading; There is no need to devise a means of safe item transfer. Does not need discussion over who upholds their end of the deal first. Scam-proof, ability to view the other party's offer before accepting. No exchange agreement needed, the deal does not move forward unless both offers are accepted by both users How to Safely Given Items There is a safer way to give an item to another player, and gather screenshot evidence that you gave this item to the other player. Though it may seem cumbersome, by taking extra precautions when performing an item transaction, you protect the integrity of the transaction by helping ensure that the person you are trading with receives the item. The safest method of securely giving an item to another person is to use a locked chest. This will require you to be on one of the main servers as you will need to be able to lock a chest. While in the overworld, place a chest, and lock the chest by using /lock or /cprivate and then clicking the chest. Give the other person (whom you are trading the item to) access to the chest by running the command /cmodify <username> . Run the /cinfo command and click the chest. Information about the chest owner and who has access will be displayed in chat. Screenshot this with a timestamp to keep for your own records and future reference, if needed. Open your inventory, and cursor over the item to show its details, and screenshot this. Put that item into the chest, and cursor over the the item to show its details, and screenshot it.

We'll explain why you may have been banned, how to appeal your ban, and give you account security advice along with preventing yourself from being compromised. Please note that being banned from Telzenith does not equate to being banned from the community; If you have been banned from Telzenith, you will still be able to participate in other parts of the community. Why Was My Account Banned? We issue these bans for a few reasons; These include but are not limited to: Irregular Login Activity Multiple logins in quick succession from multiple networks or different locations could trigger the login monitor system. Multiple accounts connecting from the same network address, such as friends or alternate accounts, that haven't been cleared with a member of the staff team may automatically trigger this too. Irregular Chat Activity Your account engaged in spambot-like behavior in the network wide chat channels. Account Sharing When your account is active on Telzenith, it is your responsibility regardless of who is accessing the account; If you let others have access to your account and they bring action against your account, you will be the one who will need to deal with the punishment and/or appeal process. VPN & Proxy Usage VPN (or proxy) usage could lead to a ban because other players may be using the same VPN/proxy to cheat or breaks the rules on. VPN (or proxy) usage could also lead to a ban from irregular login activity as it shows your account connecting to the server from the same IP address as any other accounts that utilized that VPN/proxy exit node as well. Exposure to phising In some extreme cases, we may preemptively ban your account as a preventative measure against any destruction that may be brought to your personal items and builds on the server. Hyperion Cheat Detection Our Hyperion anti-cheat system detected your account utilizing hacks and/or exploits on the server and banned your account accordingly. How can I get unbanned? In most cases, the issue is as simple as securing your Microsoft account. If youre account was compromised, it is highly recommended that you change your password as well as enable some form of two-factor authentication on your account such as the use of security questions or a login verify with a authenticator code. To add or update your Microsoft account, please refer to the how to help keep your Microsoft account safe and secure article on Microsoft's support site. After you have received a ban due to irregular login activity, After you have received a ban from Telzenith, you will be able to create and submit an appeal using the dedicated appeal form. Once your appeal has been accepted, your account will enter a recovery phase and you will be able to access the server again after a period of 48 hours has lapsed. You will not be able to appeal this temporary ban and no member of the staff team will lift it before it expires. Appeal decisions are final and will not change. Account Passwords Passwords are something all of us have online, for all of the various accounts we have whether they are personalized or randomly generated by a password manager. To help you to create secure passwords, we've come up with some general password security tips which you can find below. Use reasonably long passwords Where possible, use passwords which are at least 12 or more characters in length (a longer password is better). This helps to make your password far harder for a person or machine to guess or brute force (obtain through lots of login attempts). Use a variety of characters Use a variety of character types, including letters (capital and lowercase), numbers and special characters (e.g. !, @ and #). That said, be careful with common substitutions. \u201cP4aS5W0rd!\" is still not a necessarily a secure password and can be guessed. Use unique passwords for each online account This makes sure that if a person obtains your password for one site, they don't have your password for any others, and restricts any damage they can do. If you're an individual who struggles to remember passwords, you opt to use a password manager application to remember them for you, and some even come with strong password generators to make secure passwords for you for each service you need one for; Some common password manager providers are Dashlane and LastPass . Google GMail Accounts If you use a Google Gmail email for your accounts, you can use this trick to \"change\" your email to make it more unique and harder to guess. You can do this by adding a + after the name part of your email address (before the \"@\" sign), and then adding some text after that. For example, if you owned the email address example@gmail.com , you could use example+123@gmail.com , example+jamie@gmail.com or example+manycharacters@gmail.com . Any email sent to any of those addresses will end up in the inbox for example@gmail.com . Of course, you still need to remember this email yourself to login to these accounts, so don't make it too random that you don't remember it yourself just like your password. Two-Factor Authentication On top of passwords, some sites offer a feature called Two-Factor Authentication (sometimes also called 2FA, Multi-Factor, or Two-Step Authentication). This method of security uses a second device to generate a code which you need to login to your account, and means that even if your password is discovered by someone else they still cannot login to your account as they can't generate a code for your account. Large companies such as Google , Microsoft , and Apple offer this on their accounts already, either via an app such as Google Authenticator (or Authy) or via SMS message that gets sent to your phone. Though this is something that most people won't use for all of their accounts, we do advise it for your more important accounts such as email accounts and Microsoft account. Note: Always keep a copy of the backup codes given to you when you set up Two-Factor Authentication on any site just in-case you ever lose your phone. If you lose your phone for any reason and you don't have these codes, you're in the same position as a hacker and will be locked out of your accounts. Avoiding Compromisation There are some general items which you should always keep in mind and watch for when on the internet to make sure that you don't accidentally give out your credentials to someone or do anything which may lead to that happening. To help you with this, we've come up with a list of things to do to make sure you are secure when browsing the internet. Always check the URL/domain (address bar) When clicking on any links on the internet, always check the link to make sure it's what you expect it to be. For example, if you're being presented with a login form for your Mojang/Microsoft account, make sure the address is what you'd expect it to be (either something at mojang.com , minecraft.net , or microsoft.com ). If it's anything else, it's likely a phishing link, and the site is designed in such a way as to steal your login details. If it's too good to be true, it is! A generally good principle to use everywhere. If something seems to good to be true online, it almost certainly is. If you get an email, for example, from someone saying they just found a link to get free Minecon capes. After all, do you really think that a random person just happened to come across a link to get free capes? Never give out personal information The main one to take note of here as it is also in our community rules with regards to doxxing. There is no reason why anyone should ever need to ask you for any of your personal information or even your login credentials on any site you visit ever. That information should be kept private to you and you only. Do not click on suspicious links If you are unsure whether a link is safe, you should not click it. If someone is sending your these types of links in-game, it is recommended that you use /ignore to ignore their messages and /report to report them to our staff team. As a general tip, if you get a site asking for you to login and you're suspicious of it, try entering some random details such as \"username\" and \"password\". If it let's you \"login\", it's there to steal your details. That said, don't treat this as a reliable test either. I've Been Compromised So something has gone wrong and somewhere along the line someone has gained access to your account. The first thing you should do is to not panic; While this is a serious issue, you will need to remain calm while sorting things out as you would in any other emergency situation. Securing Your Account Change the password on your email account This is the first thing you should do when any account of yours becomes compromised. Your email address is the central part of the accounts that you use online and if someone were to gain access to it, they could potentially gain access to all of your other accounts linked to your email. Attempt to recover your account by resetting the password Once your email account has been secured, attempt to request a password reset for your compromised Microsoft account. With any luck the email address was not changed and fixing the matter should be as simple as receiving the password reset email and changing your password. If this works, change your password to something new (following our password advice provided above), and you'll be in the clear; If it doesn't work, move on the next step below. Attempt to recover your account if you can't reset the password If the email address has been changed, your next step is to attempt to contact Mojang support regarding your account getting compromised. If you migrated your account to a Microsoft account, you will need to reach out to Microsoft support instead. Mojang has created an article on their support site that provides a brief overview of the steps that are required to secure your account. You can reference their account recovery guide on their official support website . If you are using a Microsoft account with Minecraft Java Edition, please refer to Microsoft's how to recover a hacked or compromised Microsoft account article instead.

It could be related to your internet connection or something on the server itself. This method allows us to help diagnose your internet connection to the server in order to help provide further assistance on fixing your issue. MTR combines the ping and traceroute tools of your operating system into one powerful utility that has the ability to not only measure the availability of devices and the numbers of hops to reach the destination but also the ability to measure packet loss and jitter as well. Background Information What is ping? Ping is a measure of the round trip from your computer to the destination server when a request is made. Ping is measured in milliseconds (ms) and the lower the number, the lower your data transfer delays will be. What is jitter? Jitter is the rate at which ping changes over a period of time (sometimes called ping spikes or stuttering). Jittering is essentially the fluctuation or variation of latency over time. Simply put, if every information packet takes the same amount of time to travel from point A to point B, then there is no jitter. However, if the packet delivery times are inconsistent, then there is jitter. Similar to ping rates, the lower the jitter value for the connection, the better. What is a traceroute? A traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on a network from its source to the defined destination, reporting the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged in between; These are typically referred to as hops. Traceroute also records the time between each hop the packet makes during its route to the destination. What is packet loss? Packet loss occurs when one or more packets of data traveling across a computer network fail to reach their destination. Packet loss is either caused by errors in data transmission, typically across wireless networks, or network congestion. Packet loss is measured as a percentage of packets lost with respect to packets sent. MTR for Windows Download WinMTR from it's SourceForge project page and install it on your computer. Run the application and enter the IP address you wish to test into the host box at the top. In this case, we want to use mc.thengx.network. Let the MTR run until you see the number of sent packets reach a minimum of at least 100. Click Export TEXT and save the *.txt file to a directory that you can easily access it from. Upload the text file to your ticket or send it directly to the staff member who is assisting you. MTR for MacOS Install HomeBrew on your Mac. Open Terminal and enter the command: /bin/bash -c \u201c$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\u201d . Your Mac may ask you for your username and password as an added security measure. Once HomeBrew has been installed, run the command brew install mtr in the terminal window that you still have open from the previous step. After the package mtr has been installed on your Mac, you will be able to run mtr <IP address> from the terminal; Run the command of mtr mc.thengx.network . Let the MTR run until you see the number of sent packets reach a minimum of at least 100.

The general trend is that the memory footprint of Minecraft has increased over time and is majorly due to the changing vanilla landscape. Initial Steps Before we can optimize Java and Minecraft's in-game settings we should first take some initial steps into identifying what the root cause(s) of our performance drops are. Closing & Disabling Apps CPU usage is one of the main factors that influences performance in Minecraft. If your processor is constantly under load and is hitting peaks of over 80% usage while playing Minecraft, it is recommended to attempt to close some background applications that may be using your CPU runtime cycles alongside Minecraft. Some examples of applications that will typically use large amounts of CPU cycles are Adobe applications (Photoshop, Illustrator, Evolve), recording suites, media players, and web browsers; Not all applications use large amounts of CPU cycles but it is recommended to watch for those that do and to not make use of them while playing Minecraft. Applications that launch alongside your operating system, startup applications, are also a large factor in consuming CPU cycles; You can disable startup applications on Windows using this article as reference. Updating Java With the release of Minecraft's Caves & Cliffs update in 2021, Minecraft 1.18 has raised the minimum required Java version to Java 17 LTS for clients and servers alike. The major distributors of Java are Oracle , Azul , Adoptium , Amazon , and Eclipse ; Azul's Zulu builds of Java is recommended for use with Minecraft. To install and/or update Java, please refer to this tutorial article on the Minecraft wiki. Optimizing Java & Minecraft Setting Java Arguments One of the first steps that we can take towards improving our client's performance is to tweak Java's JVM that Minecraft is built upon and runs on. The following Java arguments have been the go to standard for the modding community of Minecraft and will also improve performance for vanilla clients. -Xmx4096M -Xms4096M -XX:+UseG1GC -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=51 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M An explanation of each of the Java arguments are as follows: -Xmx4096M -Xms4096M This flag configures the heap size to four gigabytes and keeps it pinned at four gigabytes. Minecraft eats a lot of memory. It is recommended that the -Xmx and -Xms flags be the same value as it will guarantee that the heap given to the JVM for Minecraft will be fully utilized by Minecraft; If the heap needs to inflate, due to a lower heap minimum size, to the maximum size it may result in out of memory errors due to conflicts with other applications that are making use of the system memory. To change the amount of memory allocated to the JVM for Minecraft, multiply 1024 by the number of gigabytes that you wish to allocate; For example, three gigabytes is would be 1024 * 3 for a heap size of 3072 ; The flags would be -Xmx3072M -Xms3072M to allocate three gigabytes to the JVM. A general rule of thumb for setting Minecraft's JVM heap size is to keep it at or above at least three gigabytes and to not exceed allocating more than eight gigabytes to the JVM (or more than 50% of your total system memory, whichever limit comes first). -XX:+UseG1GC This flag enables the G1GC garbage collector; This is a great garbage collector for interactive applications, such as Minecraft. It tries to keep garbage collection predictable, so it never takes a long time (big lag spikes) and doesn't repeatedly take lots of short times which may lead to micro-stuttering. -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646 This flag configures the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) layer not to run a full garbage collection cycle every minute. -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions This flag unlocks and enables the usage of experimental JVM arguments. -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 This flag configures G1GC to put aside 20% of the heap as \"new\" space. This is space where new objects will be allocated, in general. You want a decent amount, due to Minecraft making a large amount of objects (such as BlockPos) and you don't want to have to run a collection whenever it gets full as this is a big source of micro-stutters. -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 This flag configures the G1GC to try and not stop for more than 50 milliseconds when garbage collecting, if possible. This is a target, and G1GC will ignore you if you put a silly number in like 1 which is unattainable. 50 milliseconds is the equivalent time of one server tick. -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M This flag configures G1GC to allocate it's garbage collection blocks in units of 32megs. The reason for this is that chunk data is typically just over eight megabytes in size, and if you leave it default of sixteen megabytes, it'll treat all the chunk data as \"humungous\" and so it'll have to be garbage collected specially as a result. This will especially help in modded causes as some mods tend to cause humongous allocations as well, such as JourneyMap.

When you claim a section of land, other players will be unable to place or break blocks, kill animals, take crops, or open chests. Everything will be completely protected! To claim land, you will need to utilize a golden axe and a stick. You can craft these items yourself or do /menu receive them for free from the server gameplay menu. The golden axe is used for creating and modifying claims while the stick is used for viewing information on your claims as well as other players\u2019 claims. You can create as many claims as you want, however, there is a limit as to how many claim blocks in total that you can claim. All players start out with an allowance of 100 claim blocks when they first join the server and accrue an additional 2000 claim blocks a period of 20 hours of time spent actively playing on the server; Additional claim blocks may be purchased with in-game currency using the /buyclaimblocks command. A video guide for managing claims with GriefPrevention has also been created by The Breakdown demonstrating the basics of GriefPrevention for those who would like to view a video guide instead. Creating Claims Before creating a claim, it is recommended to see if there any are other claims owned by other players that exist nearby; Claims owned by different players are recommended to be at least 100 blocks apart unless both parties have agreed otherwise. To visualize all nearby claims, equip a stick in your main hand and shift+right-click. All nearby claims will become visible to you using a dotted outline of gold blocks and the number of nearby claims will also be displayed in chat. Once you have verified that there are no nearby claims you can begin the process of creating your first claim. To create a claim, equip a golden axe in your main hand and right-click on the ground where you would like to have the first corner of your claim marked. After marking out your first corner, you will need to go to the opposite corner (diagonally) and mark the second corner to create your claim. Please note that the vertical size of a claim is not bedrock to build limit; The lowest point of the claim starts at 5 blocks below the lowest corner you marked out. It\u2019ll keep expanding down as you place blocks lower and lower in the claim, but it may reset when you change the claim size, trust another player, create sub-claims, etc. If you want to make sure your claim stays extended all the way down, make one of the initial corners at bedrock level. Please remember to not claim any further deeper or higher than you need to. Resizing Claims Similar to the process of creating a claim, you can also resize your claims to protect more land or to conserve claim blocks. To make the outline of your claim visible, first, equip a stick and right-click anywhere within the claim. This will show the border of the claim so that you can see where the corners are. To resize a claim, equip a golden axe and right-click the corner you would like to move. After you have right-clicked the corner you wish to move, right-click again wherever you would like to move that corner to so that your claim size may be adjusted. Trusting Others If you want to add someone to your claim so that they can modify it or even just grant others a certain level of access to your claim, you can use the trust commands to accomplish this. If you wish to trust everyone on the server, simply replace the with all. /trust <player> Full claim access (break, build, inventory access, interact access, etc.). /containertrust <player> Inventory access but no building permission (chests, furnaces, etc.). /accesstrust <player> Interaction access but no building/inventory permission (doors, trapdoors, etc.). /permissiontrust <player> Allow a trusted player to trust others. Subdividing Claims Claims can be broken down into smaller mini-claims through the use of subdivisions. Subdivisions allow you to give players access to specific parts of your claim; This can be used to create and manage a town or even a shop. Another way to visualize this is that you are granting other players access to a specific section of your claim instead of the entire claim. You are still in control of the border of these mini-claims. Once a subdivision is created, you can trust people the same way as before. Just stand in the subdivision (mini-claim) and use the trust commands. The only difference this time is that it will only trust them to that subdivision. If your claim has been subdivided and you want to trust someone to your claim and not a subdivision, you will have to execute the trust command outside of the subdivisions in your claim. To create subdivisions within your claim, you will need to toggle \"subdivision mode\"; You can access this mode with either /subdivide or /subdivideclaims . Once you are in this mode, you can create subdivisions in the same manner that you would create a regular claim; The main difference is that the subdivisions will have a white outline rather than a golden one. Once you have finished managing your subdivisions, you can toggle the subdivision mode off with /basicclaims . Automatic Claim Deletion Land claims will be automatically deleted once the owner of a claim has been inactive on Telzenith for 60 consecutive days. If you are planning to be away from the server for this long, all you need to do is join the server for a few minutes within those 60 days to reset the countdown. For players who let their inactivity reach 60 days, their claims will be removed however the builds, modifications, etc. that were protected will not revert back to the original terrain; Unclaimed land is fair game to loot so make sure that your claims are active and properly sized. For other items that are affected based on the inactivity time of a player, please refer to our player data cleanup article instead.

Using Java Edition Java edition is the recommended method of connecting to Telzenith as that is the same codebase that the server network was built upon; To connect to Telzenith, simply open your Multiplayer server list on Minecraft and add a server. Set the Server Name to Telzenith and the Server Address to telzenith.xyz or thengx.network . After entering the server information, select the Done button and connect to the server network Using Bedrock Edition As mentioned, clients running Minecraft's Bedrock Edition codebase can also connect to the server network only if they are either the Windows 10 edition or Pocket edition. If you would like to connect to Telzenith on a console instead, please refer to this GeyserMC wiki article for walkthroughs on connecting to the server on PlayStation, XBox, and/or Nintendo Switch. You will need to be using the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft on your console of choice; If your Minecraft version is Minecraft ConsoleName Edition , such as Minecraft Playstation 4 Edition , you will need to download and install Minecraft Bedrock Edition, listed as Minecraft on your platform's storefront, before attempting to connect. Please note that connecting through Bedrock is more of a convenience that is provided to our players and is not the officially endorsed and supported method of connecting to the server as the complete feature set of the server may not be available. Some parity issues, such as combat, as well as graphical issues are also to be expected as well; This is something that The NGX Network cannot fix and will only be addressed by the Geyser team if reported . To connect through Bedrock, navigate to the Servers tab of the play menu and scroll down to the bottom past the partner multiplayer servers to where you have the option to add a server. Select the Add Server button to add Telzenith as one of your multiplayer servers. In the Add External Server prompt, set the Server Name to Telzenith and use the telzenith.xyz domain for the Server Address . The port field should remain untouched as we utilize Bedrock's default port of 19132 for incoming Bedrock client connections. Once you have entered relevant server information, select the Save button to return to your multiplayer servers menu. Minecraft should display Telzenith at the bottom of your server list with the server displaying its information. You can then select the server and chose to connect from there. Upon connecting to the server, you will be met with a login gateway for a Microsoft account with a valid copy of Minecraft Java Edition; Connecting to Telzenith requires an account with a purchased copy Java Edition regardless of if a player is using Java Edition or Bedrock Edition. Enter your account credentials in to the login prompt and select the Submit button. YOUR LOGIN CREDENTIALS ARE NEVER STORED SERVER-SIDE; THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GEYSER (THE BEDROCK PROXY) DOES NOT ALLOW PLAYERS TO DO DUE TO ACCOUNT SECURITY - THIS IS PURELY BETWEEN YOU AND MOJANG/MICROSOFT. If you still don't trust us, refer to this GitHub issue that someone opened asking for password saving; One of the contributors told the individual no as it would grant server owners direct access to your account credentials. There is also a second GitHub issue that was brought up where it was denied as well. After you have successfully authenticated with Mojang/Microsoft, you will be placed into the server and you'll be able to play on the server just as you were on Java Edition. Some differences between Java and Bedrock will become apparent, such as with the combat system as to where you'll need to time your attacks rather than resort to spamming them. Failover Domains In the event that players are unable to connect to Telzenith MC through the thengx.network or telzenith.xyz domains, it is recommended that they try the failover domains of thengx.net and thengx.info before beginning to troubleshoot their connection to the server and/or contact a staff member.","title":"Connecting to Telzenith"},{"location":"minecraft/welcome-guide/joining-telzenith/#connecting-to-telzenith","text":"To join the Minecraft server, players must an active member of The NGX Network\u2019s community as well as be on the server\u2019s whitelist.

Upon connecting to the server, you will be met with a login gateway for a Microsoft account with a valid copy of Minecraft Java Edition; Connecting to Telzenith requires an account with a purchased copy Java Edition regardless of if a player is using Java Edition or Bedrock Edition. Enter your account credentials in to the login prompt and select the Submit button. YOUR LOGIN CREDENTIALS ARE NEVER STORED SERVER-SIDE; THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GEYSER (THE BEDROCK PROXY) DOES NOT ALLOW PLAYERS TO DO DUE TO ACCOUNT SECURITY - THIS IS PURELY BETWEEN YOU AND MOJANG/MICROSOFT. If you still don't trust us, refer to this GitHub issue that someone opened asking for password saving; One of the contributors told the individual no as it would grant server owners direct access to your account credentials. There is also a second GitHub issue that was brought up where it was denied as well. After you have successfully authenticated with Mojang/Microsoft, you will be placed into the server and you'll be able to play on the server just as you were on Java Edition. Some differences between Java and Bedrock will become apparent, such as with the combat system as to where you'll need to time your attacks rather than resort to spamming them.","title":"Using Bedrock Edition"},{"location":"minecraft/welcome-guide/joining-telzenith/#failover-domains","text":"In the event that players are unable to connect to Telzenith MC through the thengx.network or telzenith.xyz domains, it is recommended that they try the failover domains of thengx.net and thengx.info before beginning to troubleshoot their connection to the server and/or contact a staff member.","title":"Failover Domains"},{"location":"minecraft/welcome-guide/mcmmo-parties/","text":"McMMO Parties On Telzenith, players can create their own parties that you can invite friends and fellow players to.

In this article, we will go over the various methods that players can opt to use in order to protect their personal items from theft on Telzenith. The solutions presented in this article are ranked from least secure to most secure; They are, regardless of player rank, a way of securing your items. Item Ownership (WIP) Players on Telzenith have the option of registering a unique ID to their tools, weapons, and armor. Having a unique ID assigned to your item allows it to possibly be recovered should your item ever become lost or stolen. To manage item ownership, the following commands have been created: /own This command gives your item a unique ID as well as your Minecraft UUID in the item\u2019s lore section. Upon successful execution of the command, the unique ID will also be printed to the in-game chat; We recommend screenshotting this otherwise your item cannot be found should it become lost or stolen. The /own command is also used to complete an item transfer/trade between players. /own Used when trading or transferring items between players. This will add the target player to the item but will not change ownership over; Once the new user receives the item they must execute /own while holding it in their main hand in order to complete the trade/transfer. /disown Removes ownership from the item that is currently held in your main hand. You must type the complete unique ID when executing the command. Players must be the current owner of the item they wish to remove ownership from otherwise the command will fail. GriefPevention Claims The benefit of using protection claims on Telzenith is that all inventories that are placed within a protection claim are automatically locked. One downside to this, however, is that the inventories are locked to the claim, not the player; This means that not only the owner but also anyone else who has been added to the claim through the /trust command can also open the inventories within the claim. Another downside of using protection claims is that should a protection claim disappear due to inactivity or disbandment, all inventories that were in that claim are now unlocked for anyone to access. In short, protection claims work and they will protect any inventories that are placed within them it\u2019s just advised that players should be vigilant with who they trust with their claims as well as make sure that all inventories placed in the world are actively protected by a claim. To create a claim and reference a more in-depth guide, players should refer our GriefPrevention guide . LWCX Locks On Telzenith, one of the primary methods to protect your items is with LWC Protections; They are also sometimes called locks or LWC\u2019s. LWC Protections are mainly aimed at protecting items in chests, however, players may opt to also put locks on other inventories as well as interactive blocks such as doors, trapdoors, gates, and even beds. The only real limits that are placed on locks is that they cannot be created in the Nether or End and players have a limit of 100 locks. The blocks that can have a lock applied to them are: Chest Trapped Chest Furnace Smoker Blast Furnace Dispenser Dropper Shulker Box (all colors) Wooden Doors (all wood types) Wooden Trapdoors (all wood types) Iron Door Iron Trapdoor Fence Gates (all wood types) Bed (all colors) Lectern For ease of use, we have created the following command aliases: /lock Creates a private protection lock on a block. /remlock Removes protection lock from a block. Further documentation including lock types and commands can be found on the official wiki . Ender Chest Storage Probably the most vanilla way to protect your personal items is to put them in an ender chest. Items that are placed in your ender chest are stored in a location inaccessible to others and can be accessed anytime from anywhere that there is an ender chest available. For players who put an effort into organizing their ender chest into shulker boxes, they can store roughly 729 unique items in their ender chest with more room to spare if they are also utilizing bundles. Player Vaults Similar in function to ender chests, player vaults are a double-chest in size inventory that allows players to store items in a safe, secure place that is away from the server network itself. Player vaults are also cross server so players may opt to utilize them to move items within the network as well. As mentioned, player vaults are a double-chest in sized inventory that features 54 slots for items to be placed in; For players who put an effort into managing their ender chest and use shulker boxes, they can store roughly 1,458 unique items in their ender chest with more room to spare if they are also utilizing bundles.","title":"Protecting Your Stuff"},{"location":"minecraft/welcome-guide/player-protections/#protecting-your-stuff","text":"On Telzenith, any inventory (chest, furnace, etc.) that is not protected or lock is fair game for anyone to take from without consequences.
