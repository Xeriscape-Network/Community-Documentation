# Membership
As of October 1st, 2019, The Xeriscape Network has enacted a handful of "soft" membership requirements for individuals to meet in order to maintain membership in one of the Destiny 2 clans for the community.

These requirements were put in place due to Destiny 2 clans being limited to 100 members. While we try to present minimal barriers to entry and free movement between our in game clans, we are also aware that we as The Xeriscape Network are providing a service for our members. 

Functionally, this means that routine checks will be performed to check for inactive members to kick from the clans monthly. These inactivity kicks measure against the clan requirements listed below for your personal reference; Members who fail to meet either of these criteria may be removed from our in game clans without notice. 

A clan full of inactive members and "lone wolf" players is an unacceptable quality of service; Thus, we want those clan slots to be taken up by players who are not just playing the game but are also actively teaming up with other clan members, making use of our Discord community channels, and participating in our text discussions. To put it another way, our clan member slots <u>are prioritized for players who are actively engaged</u> with others within our community. 

!!! tip "Clan Member Inactivity Removals"

	Being removed from the Destiny 2 clan due to inactivity does not constitute a removal from the overalll community; Life happens, sometimes you don't have the time or interest to play, we get that. But we also need to keep our clan rosters accurate and populated with active players who are engaged in our community.
	
	If you are removed from the clan due to inactivity, it's not the end of the world, or is it a derogatory mark on your member record; Simply [request to rejoin the clan on Bungie.net](https://destiny.xeriscape.network/) and let a staff member, preferrably a clan admin, know to approve you.

## Requirements
As established by The Xeriscape Network, the following guidelines have been enacted; Members are expected to meet and maintain a basic level of engagement in order to remain a member within the clan.

The requirements for members of our Destiny 2 clan are as follows:

* **Be Registered With [Charlemagne](https://warmind.io/)** <br />
You will need to [join the community Discord server](https://discord.xeriscape.network) and [link your Bungie account with Charlemagne](https://warmind.io/auth/discord) within 48-hours of becoming a clan member if you haven't done so already.
* **Obtain The @Destiny Linked-Role** <br />
You will also need to obtain the `@Destiny` linked-role in the Discord server after joining as this role will grant you access to the Destiny content of the server. This role can be obtained through [the linked-roles management modal in the server settings menu](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823#h_01GK286J648XF4HPGKZYW9AMQF:~:text=in%20user%20profile-,LINKED%20ROLES%20IN%20SERVERS,may%20require%20certain%20Connection%20details%20in%20order%20to%20get%20that%20role,-%2D%20for%20example%2C%20a).
* **Maintain a Basic Activity Level** <br />
Members who are inactive for a period longer than 30 days will be removed from the Destiny 2 clan to keep space open for others seeking a clan; If you were removed from the clan, simply request to rejoin and notify a staff member of your situation.
* **Contribute 25,000 Clan Experience** <br />
Members are expected to contribute a minimum amount of 25,000 clan experience throughout the current season; This is five times the maximum weekly clan experience cap for one character (5,000 clan experience).
* **Participate in Clan Events** <br />
Participate in at least one clan event each season, when hosted; Clan events that qualify include but are not limited to: PvP matches, PvE challenges, Raids, and Drop-In parties.

## Recommendations

Items listed under this section are not requirements but are more of a suggestion to have met as not having them may limit what activities in Destiny 2 that a clan member may access.

* Ownership of currently available expansions and DLC
* Season pass access for the currently available season(s)
* Be at, or within 20 points of, the current pinnacle power level cap
