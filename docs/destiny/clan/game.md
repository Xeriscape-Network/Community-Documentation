# G.A.M.E.
One of the features offered by Charlemange (Warmind.io) is the GAME (Guardian Activity Monitoring Engine) system. This is a reputation system that allows members of the clan to earn Warmind XP and earn ranking titles by completing Destiny 2 activities with a fireteam made up of clan members.

### Earning Warmind XP
As mentioned, Warmind XP can be obtained by playing with other clan members and just overall engaging with them in Destiny 2. To earn Warmind XP, at least half of activity fireteam must be members from the clan. Certain activities, especially raids, will award more experience than other activities like patrols.

Warmind XP can be earned by participating in various activities with members of Xeriscape's clan in Destiny 2. To earn experience, at least half of the players on your fireteam must be from your clan. Some activities, such as raids, will award more XP than others, such as patrols; So, engaging in activities with your clan members and participating in high-awarding activities will help you earn more Warmind XP.

Each subsequent Warmind level requires higher XP than the last, but the rate of leveling up is a secret that only the Warmind, Charlemagne knows.

## Rank Titles
As players progress and increase their Warmind G.A.M.E. rank, they will be rewarded with unique cosmetic titles on the community Discord server. These titles serve as a way to showcase the player's achievements and dedication to the clan and their fellow members, as well as a way to recognize their contributions to the community.

These titles are specific to the Warmind G.A.M.E and will be visible to other members of the Discord server, allowing for fellow clan members to easily identify and connect with one another based on their in-game accomplishments.

In addition to recognition and showcasing of achievements, the titles awarded to players as they increase their Warmind rank also serve as a means of competition among members of the clan. This competitive aspect adds an extra layer of motivation for players to continue playing and improving in the game, as well as encouraging friendly competition among clan members.

These titles, which are specific to the current in-game season, are reset at the end of each season, requiring players to maintain their performance and progress in order to keep their title.
