# Resources
In this article, you will find a variety of resources that can assist you in your journey throughout the game, both from official sources and third parties.

From the official side through Bungie, you can find information on the latest updates and patch notes, as well as support for account and technical issues. There are also [forums and communities](https://www.bungie.net/en-US/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&tSort=6&tType=0&d=3&lang=en) available where you can connect with other players and share tips and strategies.

Third-party resources include websites, such as [Destiny Item Manager](https://destinyitemmanager.com/) and [Light.gg](https://www.light.gg/), and communities that offer in-depth guides and tutorials, as well as tools and utilities to help you optimize your gameplay experience. These resources can provide a wealth of knowledge and assistance, and can be a great complement to the official resources provided by the game developers.

We hope that these resources will help you to get the most out of your time in the game, and we encourage you to explore all of the options available to you. Whether you are a new player just starting out or an experienced veteran, there is always something new to learn and discover in Destiny 2. Should you have any questions, you are also encouraged to create a thread in the [Destiny discussion forum over on the community Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/555868544244514836/1019732741950033921).
