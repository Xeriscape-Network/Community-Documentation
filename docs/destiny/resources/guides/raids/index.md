# Destiny 2 Raids
A raid is an activity in Destiny; Raids are 6-player cooperative missions that are of high challenge, and require communication between all players in a fireteam to succeed. Raids typically involve epic, climactic encounters against various bosses, culminating in intense final battles against legendary bosses across the Destiny series.
