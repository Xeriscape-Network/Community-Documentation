# Destiny 2 Dungeons
A dungeon is an activity in Destiny; Dungeons are 3-player cooperative missions that are of high challenge, and require communication between all players in a fireteam to succeed. Dungeons typically involve epic, climactic encounters against various bosses, culminating in intense final battles against legendary bosses across the Destiny series.
