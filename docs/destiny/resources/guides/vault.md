# Vault Management


## General Tips
1. Dismantle sunset gear unless it has sentimental value.
2. Do not store items for infusion; Items at the power cap can be focused at playlist vendors
3. Limit the number of duplicates for a given item or armor piece to a maximum of two.
    - It is recommended to keep one for PvE and another for PvP
	- Try to limit armor that is saved to peices with a 65+ stat perk total
4. Try to not keep multiple items of the same element and archetype
    - As an example, [No Survivors](<https://www.light.gg/db/items/3262192268/no-survivors/>) and [Parabellum](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3926811686/parabellum/) are both solar agreesive-frame submachine guns
    - Keep the one out of the multiples that has the better stats, perks, and masterwork
5. Delete any exotics that are rarely used and have been sitting in the vault for some time
6. Remember to test the weapons out, they might be good on paper, but they may not fit your playstyle
