#UserBenchmark
You may have been directed to this article because a message that you recently posted in the Discord server contained a UserBenchmark URL; This is a friendly notice detailing that UserBenchmark manipulates their benchmarks to be biased against AMD (Advanced Micro Devices).

## What is UserBenchmark
UserBenchmark is a website that allows users to benchmark the performance of their computer by comparing it to the average performance of similar devices. The website provides a range of benchmark tests that measure the performance of a computer's hardware, including the processor, graphics card, storage, and memory.

Users can submit their own benchmark results onto the website, which are then used to generate a performance score for their device. The website also provides a ranking system that compares the performance of different devices and allows users to see how their device stacks up against others.

In addition to providing benchmark results and rankings, UserBenchmark also offers a range of tools and resources for users to optimize their computer's performance. This includes recommendations for hardware upgrades and tips for improving the speed and efficiency of a device.

## Benchmark Manipulation

It has been proven that UserBenchmark is manipulating its results against AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) processors. UserBenchmark has, and still is, intentionally ranking AMD processors lower than they should be[^1], in order to favor competing Intel processors. One example is where UserBenchmark manipulated their benchmarking metrics to [heavily favor single-core performance over multi-core performance](https://youtu.be/AaWZKPUidUY?t=1010); This led to benchmarks where lower end CPUs were ranked higher than others solely because they [had a higher single-core clock or performance](https://archive.ph/2D5VZ)[^2].

When confronted with these allegations, at the time, UserBenchmark pushed back heavily mainly [resorting to insults](https://archive.ph/2s4wC) rather than trying to present facts to back their benchmarking tactics.

In conclusion, UserBenchmark has been proven to manipulate their benchmarks against AMD which may concerning and merit further investigation. While UserBenchmark can be a useful tool for understanding the relative performance of a computer, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to approach its results with caution especially when it comes to AMD.
