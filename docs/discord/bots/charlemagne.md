# Charlemagne
Charlemagne is a third-party Discord bot designed to provide detailed access to Destiny information. Created by waterpolotrev67 and Tor_Kallon, Charlemagne offers a range of tools and leaderboards for managing player stats and clan rankings.

She provides comprehensive insights into player performance and clan progress, helping you stay on top of your game. For any support needs, you can join the [Discord Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/FJFH5Qf) where the community and developers are available to assist.


## Registration
You don’t need to register with Charlemagne, but doing so links your Bungie profile to your Discord ID. This allows you to run commands without entering your Bungie name each time you want to view your personal statistics.

To access all commands, use the /register command to link your Bungie profile. This will enable the bot to access your stats.

If you're a member of the Destiny 2 clan, you must be registered with Charlemagne to access and participate in the clan activities.

## Commands
Charlemagne uses Discord’s application command syntax, so all commands start with a forward slash (`/`). To see a full list of commands, use the `/help` command or visit [Warmind.io](https://warmind.io/article/user-commands-basic).
