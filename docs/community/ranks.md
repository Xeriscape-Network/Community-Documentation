# Member Ranks
Welcome to the ranks and roles section of our help center! In this article, we'll provide an overview of the different ranks and roles within our community, as well as explain the responsibilities and privileges associated with each rank. Understanding the ranks and roles within our community is important for all members, as it helps to ensure that everyone is aware of the expectations and responsibilities of their position. We hope this article helps to clarify any questions you may have about the ranks and roles within our community. Let's get started!

## üî∞ Initiate
Initiates are individuals who have recently joined the community. They are able to participate in the community but are limited to an extent as to what they can do; They can be considered guests as they do not have the same level of access to the community that a fully ranked member would have.

One example is the [Aethereal Highlands](../../minecraft) Minecraft server where initiates can join and play on the server network but will be restricted to where they can't make use of certain membership privileges, such as land claiming.

## üéâ Member
Members are individuals who have submitted a membership application and have been accepted in the community membership. Members have complete access to the various sections of The Xeriscape Network.

To submit a membership application, individuals are encouraged to [join the community Discord server](https://discord.xeriscape.network/) to review the welcome notices and also [check out the community website](https://xeriscape.network/) as well; Applications will always be handled through the [https://apply.xeriscape.network/](https://apply.xeriscape.network/) sub-domain redirect.

## üöÄ Booster
Boosters are members of the community who have decided to pledge their support by boosting the community Discord server. When a member boosts the community Discord server, they are automatically given the Booster rank and are able to access special privileges that come with that rank; The most obvious notice will be that the username of the boosting member will be changed to a Nitro pink color as compared to the default off-white member color.

**This rank is granted upon using at least one Nitro Boost on the community Discord server.**

## ‚ú® Founder
Founding Members, *"Founders"*, are a select handful of individuals who were present in the community prior to it going public at the start of 2023. The rank of Founding Member is purely cosmetic in nature and does not grant any special permissions to members who have this rank.

**This rank can no longer be acquired as of January 1st, 2023.**

## üéì Guide
Guides are members of the community who have shown through merit to always assist other members of the community who are in need as well as answer any questions that members of the community may have. They have strong communication and teamwork skills that show when they are helping others in the community. Guides are also highly knowledgeable of and have a true passion for community and the services offered.

One example of a guide could be an individual who has run multiple raid sherpas in Destiny 2 as well as introduce members to the game and educate them on the various gameplay mechanics.

This rank is granted to members of the community who have shown through merit to be the ones who always go above and beyond, they put others before themselves. This rank is earned over an extended period of helping others in the community and is rarely granted to members.

## üé© Moderator
Moderators are members of the community who mediate discussion, settle disputes, and overall provide assistance to any members in need; Moderators are part of the communal staff team and can be seeked out should something require support from a staff member. Moderators have shown to be mature individuals who have proven to handle intense situations and are knowledgeable about the different sections of the community.

The Xeriscape network will rarely ever ask for moderator applications to be submitted; The Administration team will approach and individual in private should they believe that individual would be the best fit for a position.

**Please do not ask to become a staff member; [An announcement will be posted in the Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/555868544244514836/1027446522088005732F) should there exist a need for additional moderators.**

## ‚öúÔ∏è Administrator
Administrators are members of the community who tend to the day-to-day operations of the various systems used by Xeriscape. Administrators are the highest rank of the community and are part of the staff team.
