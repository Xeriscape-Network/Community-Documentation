# Microphone Equalization
If you've ever used a headset with a built-in microphone, you may have noticed that the sound quality may be subpar. Whether it's a "tinny" or muffled sound, or your voice just isn't loud enough for others to hear, these issues can be a major obstacle to effective communication. Fortunately, there are software tools that can help you improve the sound quality of your headset's microphone and make sure that your voice comes through loud and clear.

In this guide, we'll be looking at two programs that are designed to help you get the most out of your headset's microphone: [EqualizerAPO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/) and [Peace Equalizer GUI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/). These programs allow you to tweak and adjust various audio settings to enhance the quality of your microphone's output.

With a little bit of configuration, you can dramatically improve the sound quality of your headset and ensure that your voice is heard clearly by others. Whether you're gaming, recording a podcast, or just making a video call, having clear and crisp audio is essential for effective communication, and these tools can help you achieve that goal.
