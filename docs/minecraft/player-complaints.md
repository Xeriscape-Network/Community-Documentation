# Player Complaints
In the infrequent circumstance where a player encounters annoyance from others on Telzenith or desires uninterrupted gameplay, the recommendation is to undertake measures for self-moderation. Should a player come across messages from another player that they prefer not to see, the solution lies in ceasing the display of that player's messages in chat on Telzenith.

## Social Interactions/Chat Reports
Due to Telzenith's reliance on a dedicated chat management system, [Minecraft's Social Interactions Screen and Chat Reporting System](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Social_interactions) lack functionality for blocking and reporting chat messages on the server. Specifically, the reporting feature within Minecraft only allows for reporting Usernames and Player Skins; Messages exchanged in the network chat cannot be reported using this system.

To address this limitation, players are advised to utilize the in-game [ignore system](../features/chat#ignore-system) if they wish to conceal messages from specific players or report incidents to the staff.

## Collecting Proper Evidence
Whether you are conducting a transaction or filing a complaint, it is important to have proper evidence of your transactions, or allegations. Even though there is a record of everything that happens on Telzenith, it is your responsibility to collect appropriate evidence of your economic dealings, for your own protection from unfair allegations, or to file complaints of incomplete agreements. It is also your responsibility to collect evidence if you are filing an abuse complaint about another user.

Any attempt to submit altered or falsified evidence will be punished severely by the server. When filing a complaint, you need evidence to support your claim. Only when appropriate evidence is presented, will moderators investigate the situation.

## Example Situations
The following sections cover some example situations in which players are encouraged to collect evidence and act accordingly.

### Abuse/Harassment
If you witness in-game rule violations or chat abuse that hasn't been addressed by the staff, you have the option to submit a report using the modmail bot on Discord. Whether it occured in global chat, local chat, or a private message, filing a report is encouraged.

Ensure to capture screenshots of the abuse or harassment, including timestamps, to provide comprehensive evidence.

### Hacking
If you suspect someone is using hacks, it's crucial to collect sufficient evidence and submit a modmail ticket on the community Discord server. Consider capturing video evidence of the suspected hacking to include in your report. 

Avoid discussing or accusing individuals of hacking in-game or on the community Discord, as such actions are considered harassment. Staff members will thoroughly examine and investigate valid complaints that include supporting evidence.
