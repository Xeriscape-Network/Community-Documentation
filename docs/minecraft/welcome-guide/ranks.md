# Player Ranks & Titles

!!! warning ""

    This system is heavily under development alongside the much larger Telzenith network; As such, these ranks currently do not exist on the server network. For a list of available ranks, plrease refer to [the global community ranks](../../../community/ranks).

## Player Ranks
On Telzenith, any inventory (chest, furnace, etc.) that is not protected or lock is fair game for anyone to take from without consequences. In this article, we will go over the various methods that players can opt to use in order to protect their personal items from theft on Telzenith. The solutions presented in this article are ranked from least secure to most secure; They are, regardless of player rank, a way of securing your items.

### Drifter (Guest)
Players who have recently joined Telzenith; Drifters are individuals who have permission to explore and participate in the server network but will be limited to a certain extent as to what they can do.

One example of a gameplay restriction is that Drifters are unable to make GriefPrevention land claims and will be limited to only protecting 15 inventories using LWCX locks until they have been promoted to a Survivor.

* **LWCX Locks** <br />
Protect inventories, such as chests and furnaces, from prying eyes; Max 15 locks.
* **Player Homes** <br />
Set up to three homes in each server of Telzenith.

See [Initiate (Xeriscape Network)](../../../community/ranks/#initiate) for additional community-wide rank details.
### Survivor
Survivor is the base level player rank for Telzenith that a player can achieve after meeting the rank requirements while they are a Drifter; Players do not need to submit an application nor ask staff for promotion in order to become a Survivor.

By ranking up to Survivor, you unlock the following network features, to name a few:

* **GriefPrevention Protection Claims** <br />
