# Transaction Security

When giving an item to someone else it is important to do it safely and to gather proper evidence of the transaction. This can apply in situations like item/auction trades, item rentals/sharing, item repair, and combination services. In most situations, you may want to make an agreement before giving an item in a transaction.
When trading an item, is it a good idea to thoroughly screenshot the process of giving an item to someone else. It may seem like overkill, but by having detailed screenshot evidence, you can protect yourself from false allegations of not following through with an agreement. Please read about proper evidence and how to take screenshots

## Donâ€™t Drop Items
It is simply a bad idea to simply an item on the ground when giving it to someone, especially in a public space such as the world spawn or lobby. Another person entirely could come by and take the item before the other person has a chance to pick it up (this unknown person may even be invisible). Also, if the server crashes when you throw an item on the ground, the item may not be on the ground when you, and the person you are giving an item to, log back in.

## The SafeTrade System
Aetherlands makes use of the SafeTrade system that enables you to trade items and money with other users safely and securely. The SafeTrade system can be interacted with through the following:

* **/trade <username>** <br />
Send a trade request to a player.
* **/trade accept** <br />
Accepts a pending trade request from another player.
* **/trade deny** <br />
Denies a pending trade request from another player.

### Benefits of SafeTrade
* Safe and convenient trading; There is no need to devise a means of safe item transfer.
* Does not need discussion over who upholds their end of the deal first.
* Scam-proof, ability to view the other party's offer before accepting.
* No exchange agreement needed, the deal does not move forward unless both offers are accepted by both users

## How to Safely Given Items
There is a safer way to give an item to another player, and gather screenshot evidence that you gave this item to the other player. Though it may seem cumbersome, by taking extra precautions when performing an item transaction, you protect the integrity of the transaction by helping ensure that the person you are trading with receives the item. The safest method of securely giving an item to another person is to use a locked chest. This will require you to be on one of the main servers as you will need to be able to lock a chest.

1. While in the overworld, place a chest, and lock the chest by using `/lock` or `/cprivate` and then clicking the chest.
	* Give the other person (whom you are trading the item to) access to the chest by running the command `/cmodify <username>`.
	* Run the `/cinfo` command and click the chest. Information about the chest owner and who has access will be displayed in chat. Screenshot this with a timestamp to keep for your own records and future reference, if needed.
2. Open your inventory, and cursor over the item to show its details, and screenshot this.
3. Put that item into the chest, and cursor over the the item to show its details, and screenshot it.
4. As the other person can now access the chest, as they take the item, screenshot that the item has been taken as the chest is then empty
