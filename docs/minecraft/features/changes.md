# Vanilla Changes

MCMMO is a plugin that adds a variety of RPG-like elements to the game of Minecraft. It is designed to be used on servers running the Bukkit or Spigot version of the game, and adds a number of features that can enhance the gameplay experience for both players and server administrators.

On Aurelium, players can create their own parties that you can invite friends and fellow players to. Parties provide players the ability to use a separate party chat that is outside of the mainstream chat channel, form alliances with other player parties, share item drops, and even share earned EXP.

## Creating A Party
Parties can be created on Aurelium by players using the **/party create <name\>** command. Upon creating a party, players can use the **/party** command to view current statistical information about their party as well as information about players who have joined their party.
