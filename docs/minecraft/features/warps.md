# Warps
Telzenith's warp system acts as a practical mechanism for effortless navigation across diverse locations within the server. Beyond player-specific warps, this feature includes in-between server warps, granting users swift access to different areas. Whether facilitating travel between distinct server sections or providing easy entry to special events, warps offer a streamlined and accessible means of navigating the expansive Telzenith environment. This comprehensive system enhances overall user experience by simplifying travel logistics and ensuring seamless transitions between different facets of gameplay.

## Player Warps
Telzenith allows players to create their own warps, providing a practical means to share specific in-game locations with friends or the wider player base. Whether it's a noteworthy building, a scenic spot, or a functional hub, creating a warp allows players to easily guide others to these points of interest. This feature serves a utilitarian purpose, streamlining navigation and enhancing overall gameplay by enabling players to showcase and access preferred in-game locations effortlessly.

### Managing Warps
To create a warp, use the `/warp set <name>` command with the chosen warp name filling in the `<name>` argument. Players will need $5,000 in order to proceed with the creation of a warp, and once created, will need to pay an additional $250 every seven days as a rental fee in order to maintain that warp.

If a player wishes to manage their warps, they can access them through the main warp GUI by clicking the enderpearl. An alternative method for a player to manage their warps is by using the `/mywarps` command. Within the My Warps GUI, players can view all of their warps and edit each one according to their preferences. Some configurable options include display icon, player accessibility, category, and description.

### Promoted Warps
Telzenith also accommodates warp promotion, allowing players to select a warp for enhanced visibility within the main warp GUI. This feature is structured with different promotion times at varying rates to provide flexibility for players. By availing this option, players can strategically position their chosen warp to be readily accessible to the wider community.
