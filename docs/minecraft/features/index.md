# Server Features

Welcome to Xeriscape's Minecraft server, Aurelium Realms; A survival multiplayer (SMP) server offering a Vanilla+ experience for members of the community. This welcome guide section of the community knowledgebase will provide all of the relevant information needed to get connected to and setup on the server.

To get started, please refer to [our article for connecting to the server](connecting.md); Members who access the server will also need to link their Discord and Minecraft UUIDs together; You can reference this [handy article for a walkthrough on how to link your Discord account to your Minecraft UUID](linking.md) so that you may gain all relevant member permissions once you are verified on the server. Once you have gone through these two articles, you should be able to access and play on the server without any further steps needing to be taken.

Remember, should you ever need assistance with anything, feel free to ask around in the community channels and create a thread in the **#support** channel of the Discord server if needed.
