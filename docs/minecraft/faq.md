# Frequently Asked Questions


## Game Setup
[__How do I connect to the Minecraft server?__](#connecting){ #connecting }

You can connect to the server through either the `telzenith.xyz` domain or `xeriscape.network` domain. Please refer to the [Welcome Guide](../welcome-guide/) for additional details regarding how to [connect to the server and start playing](../welcome-guide/connecting).

If you're experiencing difficulties connecting to the server, check out our [connection troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting/connection). It contains potential solutions that may assist you in successfully connecting to the Minecraft server.

<br />
[__What version of Minecraft does the server use?__](#minecraft-version){ #minecraft-version }

The Xeriscape Network strives to maintain the Minecraft server with the latest stable version of Minecraft Java Edition. Due to limited development time for some of the server's software, there may be occasional periods between major updates where the server runs on the previous version.

For players, it's essential to ensure that your client is running an [officially licensed copy of Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc), with a version that either matches or is newer than the version the server is currently running.

For instance, if the server is hosted on Minecraft version 1.18.2, clients running at least version 1.18.2 or a newer version can connect. Clients running a newer version will be limited to the features present in the server's version.

Please note that clients and launchers using alternate account systems, such as TLauncher, or cracked/*"pirated"* clients allowing unlicensed instances of Minecraft, are not supported and will result in an inability to connect to the server.

[__Can I invite people to the server?__](#family-friends){ #family-friends }

<br />
[__Can I use an alternate account?__](#alternate-accounts){ #alternate-accounts }

Alternate accounts, *'alts'*, are permitted on the server provided they do not interact with each other or serve to unfairly boost a player's primary account.

## Discord Access
[__How do I join the Discord server?__](#wiki-help){ #wiki-help }

The community Discord server can be joined via its [invite URL](https://discord.xeriscape.network). To access the Minecraft-specific channels, you will need to assign yourself the `Minecraft` role; To participate within the channels, you will need to [link your Minecraft account UUID with your Discord account ID via the Telzenith Discord bot](../welcome-guide/linking).

## Gameplay Mechanics
[__How do I X? / How do I use X?__](#wiki-help){ #wiki-help }

The Minecraft server has a dedicated section on the community support website for everything related to the server from in-game systems to troubleshooting guides; The section can be accessed via either URL of [https://support.xeriscape.network/minecraft](https://support.xeriscape.network/minecraft) or [https://wiki.telzenith.xyz/](https://wiki.telzenith.xyz/); The /wiki command in game will also present you with the two URLs. Some basic questions, when asked in chat, will also be auto-answered by the server itself; One example is the question How do I claim land?.

For Vanilla gameplay mechanics, it is advised to use the [community wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/) as a reference.

<br />
[__Can a plugin or feature be added?__](#feature-suggestion){ #feature-suggestion }

If you are looking to ask for an addition or change to the server, head on over to the [suggestions forum](https://discord.com/channels/555868544244514836/1027461719364223036) in the [community Discord server](https://discord.xeriscape.network/) and create a thread topic there; It is advised to read the [Suggestion Submission Guide](../../community/feedback/suggestions) prior to posting a suggestion however.

<br />
[__Can the server get the 'XYZ' modpack?__](#modpack){ #modpack }

Telzenith is built upon Minecraft's Vanilla experience and has been optimized and enhanced through the incorporation of server plugins, scripts, and a custom datapack. Given the server's design philosophy and the additional resources and heightened maintenance demands associated with modpacks, unfortunately, the server cannot operate within a modded environment.

<br />
[__How do I protect my stuff?__](#protections){ #protections }

On Telzenith, a variety of systems are in place granting players the ability to protect their items.

Player homes and builds can be protected using [protection claims](../features/claims). Inventories within claims, including chests and furnaces, are also protected but can be accessed by other claim members. Since player claims safeguard physical parts of the server world, if a claim owner is inactive for more than 90 days, their claim will expire, allowing all players to modify the blocks within the claim.

<br />
[__Is PvP enabled or allowed on the server?__](#pvp){ #pvp }

PvP is permitted on the server, but it's a voluntary feature. Players can toggle their PvP state using the /pvp command. Players who enable PvP will have a red dagger next to their username, denoting their active PvP status. Keep in mind that players with PvP activated can engage in combat only with others who have also enabled PvP for themselves.

<br />
[__Is there a donator rank or any other forms of monetization?__](#donations){ #donations }

Telzenith is offered free of charge and will never be monetized. If you wish to support the community, boosting the Discord server is a recommended way to contribute. This helps us unlock features that Discord has placed behind server boosts.

Additionally, by boosting the Discord server, you will be granted the Booster role on both the Discord and Minecraft servers.

## Chat System
[__Why are links blocked in the chat?__](#chat-links){ #chat-links }

To ensure a safe and enjoyable environment, a majority of links have been blocked from being posted in the chat to prevent the spread of malicious content, phishing attempts, or inappropriate material. While the majority of links are blocked, there are exceptions; A select few links may be whitelisted based on their relevance or importance to the community.

If you have a link you believe should be considered for whitelisting, please contact our support team with details for review.

It's worth mentioning that the Discord server may have more relaxed rules regarding what links are allowed to be posted. Feel free to share relevant links and information on Discord, keeping in mind the community guidelines. However, be cautious and ensure that the content complies with our overall community policies. 

<br />
[__Why do I not have access to the X channel?__](#chat-channels){ #chat-channels }

Channel access is determined by player ranks within the server and the broader Xeriscape community. While all publicly available channels are open to all server players, [certain conditions](../features/chat#channel-directory) may need to be met to send and receive messages in specific channels.

If you previously had access to the VIP chat channel and no longer do, it may be because your Discord boost expired, leading to the automatic removal of your Booster rank on the server and consequently, the loss of access to the channel.

The Party chat channel is exclusive to members of your [McMMO party](../features/mcmmo). To send and receive messages in this channel, you must be part of an active [McMMO party](../features/mcmmo), allowing communication only with online party members.

<br />
[__Why is chat reporting disabled?__](#chat-reporting){ #chat-reporting }

Chat reporting is disabled on our server as part of our commitment to managing issues in-house. We believe in the importance of community moderation and maintaining the autonomy for our community to manage what can be said within it. Disabling external reporting helps ensure that moderation powers remain within the community, rather than being influenced by Mojang.

Our staff team is dedicated to maintaining a positive and respectful environment for all players. If you encounter any issues or need to report something, please feel free to reach out directly to our staff team. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in fostering a community-driven approach to moderation.

<br />
[__How do I hide player messages?__](#chat-messsage-hiding){ #chat-messsage-hidding }

Due to our server's utilization of a custom chat system, Minecraft's Vanilla chat features, including message hiding through the [Social Interactions Screen](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Social_interactions), are disabled. However, we've implemented a robust [ignore system](../features/chat#ignore-system) to address this.

To hide messages from specific players, you can make use of the [ignore system](../features/chat#ignore-system). This not only allows you to hide messages in the chat from selected players but also blocks other elements such as direct messages and mail.

## Connection
[__Why is my ping so high?__](#connection-ping){ #connection-ping }

The most common reasons behind a high ping typically include your internet connection speed, physical distance between your location and the server's host location, and potential network congestion.

To improve your connection, consider closing unnecessary background applications and ensuring a stable internet connection by using a wired network solution rather than a wireless one. If the issue persists, you may want to contact your internet service provider for further assistance.

Additionally, server performance and the number of players online can impact ping, so try connecting during non-peak hours for a potentially smoother experience. 

There is also a [connection troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting/connectivity) available offering in depth guides and potential solutions.

## Moderation

[__Why was I muted?__](#mute){ #mute }

When a player is muted, they will be temporarily blocked from sending chat messages. Upon the application of the mute, a message will be sent to them in chat, providing both notification of the mute and the specific reason for it.

If a muted player attempts to send messages, they will receive a reminder of their mute along with the expiration date, if applicable, indicating when they will be able to send messages again.

It's important to note that when a player is muted, they are not only restricted from sending messages in any of the chat channels but are also blocked from sending private messages and mail to other players.

<br />
[__Why was I kicked?__](#kick){ #kick }

When a player is kicked from the server, they will see a screen providing details on the reason for their removal. We recommend reviewing this information to understand the cause behind the kick. We ask players to take this opportunity to reflect on the behavior that led to the kick and consider adjusting it to align with the server guidelines.

Continuing the behavior that resulted in the kick may result in harsher punishments in the future. If you have any questions or concerns about the kick or need further clarification, feel free to reach out to our staff for assistance.

<br />
[__Why was I banned?__](#ban){ #ban }

When a player is banned from the server, the reason for the ban is displayed at the time of the ban and when attempting to reconnect while banned. If you have been temporarily banned, you will also see the expiration date indicating when you can rejoin the server.

<br />
[__How do I appeal my punishment?__](#appeal){ #appeal }

For information on appealing your punishment, please refer to the dedicated punishment appeal article. This resource outlines the process for submitting an appeal, and it provides guidelines on what information is needed for a successful appeal.

If you have any specific questions or concerns regarding your punishment, feel free to reach out to our staff for assistance.

<br />
[__How can I apply for a staff position?__](#staff-position){ #staff-position }

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our server as a staff member. Currently, staff positions are not available for direct application. Any future openings will be announced in the community announcements; We advise keeping an eye on those announcements for information on staff position availability.
