# Hyperion Anti-Cheat

Hyperion is our Cheat Detection System. Hyperion gathers and analyses data on numerous users randomly at the same time and determines whether a person is utilizing hacks or exploits to grant themselves an unfair advantage or not.

When Hyperion detects a user using unfair advantages, it records the data of the player and they are punished promptly. We have configured Hyperion to be successful at spotting cheaters and we cannot reveal the exact details as to how it works.

## Why was I banned?
If you were banned by Hyperion, your ban message will include Hyperion Cheat Detection. This means that you were monitored, caught, and confirmed to be in one or more of the following categories:

* Actively using one or more unfair advantages (cheats/hacks).
* Previously used one or more blacklisted modifications that have outstanding effects on your Minecraft client.
* Using one or more disallowed modifications or external tools such as, but not limited to, TCP edit, Better Sprint, macros, and/or auto-clickers

## Cheat Policy
It is important you read and understand the following policy in regards to our anticheat system.

Upon detection of a player using cheats:
- The player will receive an automatic ban of 14 days; Any attempts to connect to the server during the ban duration will result in a ban screen being presented to the player with their ban reason and time before expiration.
- Once a ban has expired, the system will automatically remove the ban


## How can I appeal?
To appeal a Hyperion ban, please refer to our appeal guide. If you have received a response on your appeal, that decision is final and it will not change.

## How can I prevent this?
* Make sure to read and follow our latest community rules.
* Check to see if your modifications are allowed on our network.
* Make sure your Minecraft client is clean.
* Do not use any automated or toggling macros

## Frequently Asked Questions
* **Is X modification allowed on the server?** <br />
You can find out more about allowed modifications here. If the modification provides any form of advantage over other players on the server, we strongly recommend disabling or removing it.
* **Will I ever be 100% sure that my modification(s) are safe?** <br />
No; That is why The Xeriscape Networks always recommends using a vanilla client when possible. If you still opt to mod your Minecraft installation, make sure that your mods are being downloaded from a reputable place such as GitHub or CurseForge; It is recommended to not download mods from any sites that have been [flagged by the StopModReposts](https://stopmodreposts.org) community as they may contain viruses and malware.
* **I have used modifications in the past, am I at risk of being banned?** <br />
No, as long as they are no longer installed and you are no longer using them on the server. However, some modifications have been found to tamper with your *.jar in your Minecraft installation folder.
* **If I have client hacks/modifications installed but aren’t actively using them, am I at risk?** <br />
You still may be at risk; Some modifications interact with the client, and server, even if you aren’t actively using them. Simply having them installed may result in automatic punishment.
* **Will I be banned for using an operating system that isn’t Windows?** <br />
There are a wide variety of operating systems that players use that aren’t strictly Windows. Simply using an operating system that isn’t Windows will not result in a ban from the server.
* **Does Hyperion have access to my computer and its files?** <br />
Hyperion does not have access to your files stored on your computer; Hyperion is a server-side anti-cheat system that monitors network traffic to and within Telzenith.
* **Will I be banned for having an inconsistent/unstable connection?** <br />
No, Hyperion is able to differentiate between someone hacking and someone experiencing connectiong issues.
* **Can I be falsely banned by Hyperion?** <br />
We believe that Hyperion itself is able to differentiate between cheaters/hackers and non-cheaters/hackers fairly well and punish them as configured. If you believe that you have been falsely banned by Hyperion, please submit an appeal.
* **Does Hyperion favor any specific person?** <br />
Hyperion does not factor in any rank, permissions, etc. when it comes to detection. It will apply punishment equally.
* **Does Hyperion affect gameplay in any manner?** <br />
Hyperion is a background cheat detection system, it does not modify the gameplay experience of the server. You won’t even notice that the system is there in the first place.
