# Mods & Hacks Policy

Minecraft mods greatly enhance the player experience, offering improvements in performance, visuals, and gameplay. Due to the diverse functionality mods provide, not all are permitted on Telzenith.

## Client Mods

### Preface
Before utilizing any modifications, players should be aware that the use of modifications on the server is entirely at their own risk, including those mentioned as examples in this guide. The staff team cannot review every version of each modification, so they cannot guarantee that modifications adhere to the community rules.

Players should always obtain any installed modifications from their official source, whether it's the creator's website, [GitHub](https://github.com/), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods), or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/). Unofficial downloads from alternative sources may not function as expected and could potentially be malicious (e.g., viruses, spyware, etc.). A compilation of unsafe mod websites is available on the [StopModReposts project website](https://stopmodreposts.org/sites.html) project website, a collaborative effort aimed at educating individuals about the risks associated with mod reposting.

### Modification Types
Provided below is a list of the categories of modifications we permit on the server, along with an explanation of what each of these categories does and does not include and permit. If a modification does not fit into one of these categories, it should be assumed that it is disallowed by default.

* **Performance** <br />
Modifications that simply seek to improve the performance of Minecraft by reducing lag, increasing frame rates, and/or optimizing graphics.
* **Aesthetic** <br />
Modifications that change the game's appearance or visual style in some way; These modifications can range from simple texture replacements to custom models and animations.
* **Quality of Life (QoL)** <br />
Modifications which alter the overall experience by making certain aspects of the game, such as inventory management, more convenient or easier to use. These types of mods include a wide variety of features from UI improvments to extra tweaks that make certain processes easier.

!!! tip "Uncategorized Client Mods"
	If a modification doesn't neatly fall into any permitted categories or exceeds standard usage limits, providing an advantage (e.g., an x-ray texture pack), it is deemed disallowed on the server. In cases of uncertainty about a mod's permissibility, players are encouraged to err on the side of caution and to simply not use the mod while connected to Telzenith or seek clarification from a staff member.

### Allowed Client Modifications
Here are a few select modifications available for use on Telzenith[^1]. Primarily, these encompass cosmetic changes or provide limited additional information that should not confer an in-game advantage.

* **OptiFine/Sodium (Client Optimization Mod)** <br />
Client modifications which have the main goal of improving client FPS (Frames Per Second) by optimizing the way Minecraft operates and offering more customizable Video Settings.
* **Shaders/Iris Shaders, Sildurs Shaders, etc. (Shaders)** <br />
Client modifications that change the visual appearance of the game to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
* **Inventory Tweaks, Inventory Sorter, etc. (Inventory Management)** <br />
Client modifications that allow for inventory management to be automated or made easier.
* **Replay Mod (Gameplay Recorder)[^2]** <br />
Client modification which allows for the recording and playback of gameplay, while also allowing for the changing of perspective during playback (but not in live gameplay).
* **Badlion Client, etc. (Clients/Mod Packs)[^3]** <br />
Minecraft client mods (sometimes made available as self-contained clients) which contain a variety of modifications grouped together into a single package are permitted, provided the included modifications are permitted on our server by themselves.
* **F3+B (Minecraft Debug Screen)** <br />
Built-in debug tool in the vanilla Minecraft client which shows entity (player, mob, etc) hitboxes. It is an official feature of Minecraft; Not a client modification.

	The showcased modifications serve as examples and are not officially endorsed by Xeriscape. Installing modifications on a player's client is done at their own risk.

[^2]:
	Unfortunately we are not able to accept evidence for reports submitted to us which have been recorded using these modifications. This is due to the potential for these reports to be edited or fabricated, leading to false reports.

	We recommend that anyone opting to use custom clients to do their own research into the background of those clients before use. The Xeriscape Network recommends that players should use vanilla Minecraft client jars downloaded from Mojang.

### Disallowed Client Modifications
While a specific list of prohibited modifications does not exist, a general guideline dictates that any modification providing a substantial gameplay advantage over others on the server is not allowed, as it goes against the established rules of Telzenith.

Moreover, it is important to highlight that any form of automation for player gameplay actions is strictly prohibited, whether facilitated through Minecraft modifications, external software, or hardware. This includes actions like auto/burst clicking buttons or macros, auto-sprint, aim assists, and bots/self-bots such as Baritone.

Lastly, modifications that modify how Minecraft client interacts with and communicates with the server network are also disallowed. Ensure that any used modifications are exclusively client-side, refraining from altering the game's behavior.

## Hacked Clients
Hacked clients, commonly known as *clients*, encompass modifications that provide players with unfair advantages over others; these are not allowed on Telzenith. Players caught using any client deemed to be a hacked client, such as Future, Impact, Nodus, Vape, and Wurst (popular examples), may face automatic banning by the network's anti-cheat system. Although the use of hacked clients outside of Telzenith falls outside of Xeriscape's jurisdiction, it is recommended to use a vanilla client while accessing the server to avoid potential bans.
