Send two players to each plate.</p> <p>Begin by standing in all of the plates to build a connection. Once this happens, Vex will begin spawning. The smaller units, like Goblins and Hobgoblins, cannot take the plates back. The only enemy that can severe the connection and turn the plate red are the Praetorians. Focus on killing these Praetorians before they reach your plate. They will alternate their spawn points.</p> <p>As you fight off the advancing vex, several cyclops will spawn around the area. These must be neutralized as fast as possible as they can deal extreme amounts of damage; Use supers and heavy to knock them down fast.</p> <p>It\u2019s not required that you stay on the plate once the connection has been made. In fact, it can sometimes make it more difficult. Just focus on stopping the Praetorians.</p> <p>You can track your progress by looking to the center of the opening area where the spire will be forming inside a vex latticework.

If the oracles are destroyed in the wrong order, your team will be marked and will eventually wipe.</p> <p>The oracle encounter in Destiny 2\u2019s version of Vault of Glass requires that the oracles be defeated in the order that they spawn. This means communication is key and players must recall which oracle spawned and when.</p> <p>Ideally, you will have players assigned to an area where an oracle spawns. They will count the chimes as the oracles spawn and call out the number when their oracle appears. For example, if the oracle you\u2019re watching appears on the fourth chime, you will defeat it fourth. To make this easy, each player should call out their number when the oracles first appear and call out their number again as they destroy the oracle \u2013 this way each person knows when it\u2019s their turn.</p> <p>During this encounter, Goblins and Minotaurs will spawn in the area and Hobgoblins will snipe you from the outer distant blocks. You must deal with these or avoid them as you destroy the oracles.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting there are seven oracles in the area, which means one player will be responsible for watching and destroying two of them.</p> <p>It can help to label the oracle locations so you know where they are.

It will be their job to destroy at least one Oracle, take down the Templar\u2019s shield, and protect the team using the relics's shield function. Use the shoot button to heavy attack (which is a slam when activated in mid-air), the melee button for a fast attack, your aiming/ADS button for the shield, and the super buttons to do the relic\u2019s firing attack (which removes the Templar\u2019s shield). If the Relic is dropped, it will wipe the team after 10 seconds unless someone picks it up.</p> <p>The fight starts as soon as the relic is picked up. From here, the person with the relic should hang around one side to see where the oracles spawn. Two other people should also assist. After the first three oracles spawn, defeat them in the order they appeared.</p> <p>When the oracles are gone, the person with the relic should use the super ability to destroy the Templar\u2019s shield. You can get Super energy faster by defeating enemies or oracles with the relic.</p> <p>As soon as the Templar\u2019s shield has been destroyed, all players (excluding the Relic holder) should begin damaging the Templar \u2013 it\u2019s weak point is the head of the vex hydra. A random player, with exception of the relic holder, will also be marked for detain, they will need to move away from the other team members and will need to have their detain bubble popped once it appears.</p> <p>After a few seconds, the Templar will create a ring on the ground to indicate where it will teleport. When it teleports, it will regain its shield and then the previous steps will need to be repeated until the Templar dies.</p> <p>One strategy to increase amount of time in the damage phase is for the relic holder to prevent the Templar from teleporting. This is done by standing in the teleportation circle it makes. If done in time, the circle will change color and eventually disappear \u2013 you must stay in the circle until it disappears. If you get out of the circle before then the Templar will still teleport to that location.</p> <p>The challenge of this method is that if you prevent the Templar from teleporting, it will spawn Praetorians for every successful block. This means the team may need to clear these strong Minotaurs while also focusing on damage.</p> <p>If you want to prevent the Templar from teleporting, a good strategy is to use the platforms near the starting point of the arena \u2013 right where the Templar spawns. As of Season of the Splicer, a Ward of Dawn with Weapons of Light and then a Well of Radiance further along the platform will allow teams to deal a lot of damage. Being this close means you can also use precision shotguns (like First In, Last Out) to deal a lot of damage. Using Anarchy allows players to have other sources of continual damage while using a Shotgun. As time goes on and weapon changes are implemented, the weapons you use will differ, but the strategy of using this corner to deal damage remains viable.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"destiny/resources/guides/raids/vault-of-glass/#gorgons-labyrinth","title":"Gorgon's Labyrinth","text":"<p>Though not technically an encounter, players must still pass through the Gorgon\u2019s Labyrinth without dying.

This player will pick up the portal and take it out into the main room and drop it for the player at the other side. This player will take the relic into the other portal, defeat the Praetorian, and drop the relic for the other player.</p> <p>To start the encounter, defeat the Gatekeeper that is in the center. It will teleport around the arena until it is defeated. Once defeated, grab the relic that spawns in the middle in front of the island. While the relic is being picked up, the other players should be opening both portals at the same time by standing on the vex sync plates.</p> <p>When both portals are active, send one player into one portal and another player into the other. These players defend a conflux and call out who has the Praetorian. As soon as the Praetorian is called out, the player with the relic should immediately enter their portal.</p> <p>As this is playing out, another Gatekeeper will spawn, turning off the portals. The Gatekeeper must be defeated before the portals will reactivate. A Gatekeeper will spawn around about the same time a Praetorian spawns. If everything goes according to plan, six Gatekeepers will be defeated before the final phase begins (including the starting Gatekeeper).</p> <p>While all this is happening, one or two players will be defending the vex sync plates. These plates will be continually assaulted by Goblins and Overload Minotaurs. If an Overload Minotaur reaches the plate, it will claim it, shutting down the portal. Try to defeat them as soon as they appear.</p> <p>After enough Praetorians are defeated, a conflux will appear in the main throne room. At this point, all players should return to the main area and defend it. The player with the relic will need to remove the shield of any Praetorians that spawn. Three Wyverns will also spawn close to the end of the encounter.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"destiny/resources/guides/raids/vault-of-glass/#atheon-times-conflux","title":"Atheon, Time's Conflux","text":"<p>The final encounter in the Vault of Glass is against Atheon, Time\u2019s Conflux. This encounter teleports three players at random through one of the portals where they must collect a Relic and defeat three sets of three Oracles in the correct order before escaping. Once freed, damage can be dealt to Atheon thanks to the Time\u2019s Vengeance buff.</p> <ol> <li>Destroy the Vex cube to start the fight</li> <li>Defeat Harpies until three players are teleported \u2013 teleported players say which portal they were teleported to</li> <li>Three players on the outside call out the order that the Oracles appear while defeating Supplicants. They also open the correct portal using the Vex sync plate.</li> <li>Three players on the inside collect the Relic and destroy the Oracles in the correct order then exit through the portal</li> <li>All players deal damage to Atheon while the Time\u2019s Vengeance buff lasts</li> <li>Repeat the steps until Atheon is defeated \u2013 it does not have a final stand</li> </ol> <p>The main mechanic in this encounter that must be perfected is the oracle callouts. Much like the Oracle and Templar encounters, these Oracles must be destroyed in the correct order. The difference here is that the players on the outside will need to communicate the spawn order to the players that get teleported. For the players that get teleported, the Oracles will appear to spawn at the same time. If the Oracles don\u2019t die in the correct order or are destroyed too late, the whole team will die. There are only two rows of Oracles, so label them in whatever fashion works for your team; It is however, recommended to use the callouts supplied below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Begin the encounter by destroying the Vex cube that is floating over the central island. At the point Atheon will spawn and Harpies will begin flying into the throne room. Defeat Harpies while avoiding Atheon\u2019s attacks until three players are teleported; It is recommended to leave one Harpie on each side to prevent additional from spawning in.</p> <p>For the players that remain in the throne room, the task is to open the portal to the area where the other three players were teleported. Meanwhile, they must watch for the oracles that spawn above the throne room. The order the oracles spawn must be relayed to the players on the inside. This is repeated three times until a total of nine oracles are defeated.</p> <p>The team that gets teleported must immediately say which side they were teleported to. The side that looks like a jungle (commonly called \"Venus\") is on the right and the desert side (commonly called \"Mars) is on the left. Once this information is shared, the vex portal can be opened.</p> <p>While this is happening, one player must grab the relic. They will need to use it to destroy Praetorians that spawns down by the portals (the Praetorians will spawn near the teleport you use to exit) and run across the throne room to the other side so that the orientation matches with the main throne room. During this time, the oracles will appear and must be destroyed in the order indicated by the outside team. The relic holder will also need to use the relic\u2019s cleansing bubble to remove the blinding effect from everyone inside a portal.</p> <p>When nine oracles are destroyed, the players should leave through the portal as fast as possible. When the last Oracle dies, every player will receive a 30 second buff called Time\u2019s Vengeance which increases ability regeneration and allows everyone to damage Atheon.</p> <p>All players should get into a position to best damage Atheon. The prevailing strategy is to use the stairs on the side where the team comes through the portal. A Ward of Dawn to the side for Weapons of Light and a Well of Radiance on the stairs means you can be nice and close to Atheon to deal damage.</p> <p>During the damage phase, a player at random will receive a debuff called <code>Imminent Detain</code>. When this reaches zero, it will detain the player and anyone too close to them. The player should quickly get away from the other players and wait for their teammates to free them by shooting the detainment field.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the relic\u2019s shield does not block Atheon\u2019s damage, so it\u2019s only purpose here is to cleanse players that come out of the portals. During the damage phase, the player with the relic can drop it momentarily to deal damage to Atheon, however it is not advised; Remember, if you do drop it, the Relic must be picked up within 10 seconds or it will wipe the team.</p> <p>When Time\u2019s Vengeance ends, the relic will disappear and all players should get to a safe place. Be careful, as there\u2019s a good chance a lot of Supplicants and Harpies will remain around the periphery. Quickly defeat as many of them as possible before the next teleportation occurs and the fight repeats.</p> <p>Repeat all of this until Atheon is defeated; As soon as Atheon dies, you can claim your rewards from the far side of the throne room.</p> <p>As for optimal weapons to use during this encounter, the main hurdle for players may be destroying the oracles. If the three players are shooting the same oracle, you can use primary weapons and save heavy ammo. Another option is to use a sniper rifle, which will allow you to save your Power weapon for Atheon.</p> <p>The main key to victory will be ensuring player survivability during the fight. A Well of Radiance or Ward of Dawn are almost critical for this reason, however, seasoned players can likely do without.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"destiny/resources/guides/raids/vault-of-glass/#collectibles-secrets","title":"Collectibles &amp; Secrets","text":""},{"location":"destiny/resources/guides/raids/vault-of-glass/#bitterpearl-shader","title":"Bitterpearl Shader","text":"<p>Players who took a tour around the starting area of the Vault of Glass in Destiny 2 may have stumbled upon crystals scattered across the entrance to the raid in Venus.

This helps to make your password far harder for a person or machine to guess or brute force (obtain through lots of login attempts).</li> <li>Use a variety of characters  Use a variety of character types, including letters (capital and lowercase), numbers and special characters (e.g. !, @ and #). That said, be careful with common substitutions; \"P4aS5W0rd!\" is still not a necessarily a secure password and can be guessed.</li> <li>Use unique passwords for each online account  This makes sure that if a person obtains your password for one site, they don't have your password for any others, and restricts any damage they can do. If you're an individual who struggles to remember passwords, you may opt to use a password manager application to remember them for you, and some even come with strong password generators to make secure passwords for you for each service you need one for; One such example of a commonly used  password manager is BitWarden.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"minecraft/troubleshooting/account-security/#google-gmail-accounts","title":"Google GMail Accounts","text":"<p>If you use a Google Gmail email account, you can use this trick to \"change\" your email to make it more unique and harder to guess by creating unique emails for a specific purpose.

To help you with this, we've come up with a list of things to do to make sure you are secure when browsing the internet.</p> <ul> <li>Always check the URL/domain (address bar)  When clicking on any links on the internet, always check the link to make sure it's what you expect it to be. For example, if you're being presented with a login form for your Mojang/Microsoft account, make sure the address is what you'd expect it to be (either something at <code>mojang.com</code>, <code>minecraft.net</code>, or <code>microsoft.com</code>). If it's anything else, it's likely a phishing link, and the site is designed in such a way as to steal your login details.</li> <li>If it's too good to be true, it is!  A universally sound principle to apply in any situation is that if something appears too good to be true online, it likely is. Consider, for instance, receiving an email claiming that someone has stumbled upon a link to obtain free Minecon capes. Seriously, does it seem plausible that a random person would coincidentally discover such a link for free capes?</li> <li>Never give out personal information  This remains critical, as it aligns with the community guidelines, specifically pertaining to doxxing. In general, there exists no valid basis for individuals to seek personal information or login credentials from anyone. It is recommended to keep such details private for the individual's exclusive use.</li> <li>Do not click on suspicious links  When unsure about the safety of a link, it's best to avoid clicking on it. If someone shares these links during in-game interactions, consider using the ignore system to mute a player's messages. Also remember to report the matter to the staff team.</li> </ul> <p>As a general tip, if you get a site asking for you to login and you're suspicious of it, try entering some random/default credentials such as \"username\" and \"password\". If it let's you \"login\", it's there to steal your details; With that being said however, don't treat this as a reliable test either.</p>"},{"location":"minecraft/troubleshooting/account-security/#ive-been-compromised","title":"I've Been Compromised","text":"<p>So something has gone wrong and somewhere along the line someone has gained access to your account.

Jitter is the rate at which ping changes over a period of time (sometimes called ping spikes or stuttering). Jittering is essentially the fluctuation or variation of latency over time. Simply put, if every information packet takes the same amount of time to travel from point A to point B, then there is no jitter. However, if the packet delivery times are inconsistent, then there is jitter. Similar to ping rates, the lower the jitter value for the connection, the better.</li> <li>What is a traceroute?  A traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on a network from its source to the defined destination, reporting the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged in between; These are typically referred to as hops. Traceroute also records the time between each hop the packet makes during its route to the destination.</li> <li>What is packet loss?  Packet loss occurs when one or more packets of data traveling across a computer network fail to reach their destination.

The following Java arguments have been the go to standard for the modding community of Minecraft and will also improve performance for vanilla clients.</p> JVM Arguments<pre><code>-Xmx4096M -Xms4096M -XX:+UseG1GC -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646\n-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20\n-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=51 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M\n</code></pre> <p>An explanation of each of the Java arguments are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>-Xmx4096M -Xms4096M  This flag configures the heap size to four gigabytes and keeps it pinned at four gigabytes. Minecraft tends to use a large amount of memory. It is recommended that the <code>-Xmx</code> and <code>-Xms</code> flags be the same value as it will guarantee that the heap given to the JVM for Minecraft will be fully utilized by Minecraft; If the heap needs to inflate, due to a lower heap minimum size, to the maximum size it may result in out of memory errors due to conflicts with other applications that are making use of the system memory. To change the amount of memory allocated to the JVM for Minecraft, multiply 1024 by the number of gigabytes that you wish to allocate; For example, three gigabytes is would be <code>1024 * 3</code> for a heap size of <code>3072</code>; The flags would be <code>-Xmx3072M -Xms3072M</code> to allocate three gigabytes to the JVM. It is also advised to not set the heap any amount lower than two gigabytes (<code>-Xmx2048M -Xms2048M</code>).</p> <p>Java Virtual Machine Memory Allocations</p> <p>Set the JVM heap size for Minecraft within the range of three to six gigabytes, avoiding allocation beyond 50% of your system memory. It's worth noting that exceeding eight gigabytes may lead to constant garbage collection, potentially hampering performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>-XX:+UseG1GC  This flag enables the G1GC garbage collector; This is a great garbage collector for interactive applications, such as Minecraft. It tries to keep garbage collection predictable, so it never takes a long time (big lag spikes) and doesn't repeatedly take lots of short times which may lead to micro-stuttering.</p> </li> <li>-Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646  This flag configures the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) layer not to run a full garbage collection cycle every minute.</li> <li>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions  This flag unlocks and enables the usage of experimental JVM arguments.</li> <li>-XX:G1NewSizePercent=20  This flag configures G1GC to put aside 20% of the heap as \"new\" space. This is space where new objects will be allocated, in general. You want a decent amount, due to Minecraft making a large amount of objects (such as BlockPos) and you don't want to have to run a collection whenever it gets full as this is a big source of micro-stutters.</li> <li>-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50  This flag configures the G1GC to try and not stop for more than 50 milliseconds when garbage collecting, if possible. This is a target, and G1GC will ignore you if you put a silly number in like 1 which is unattainable. 50 milliseconds is the equivalent time of one server tick.</li> <li>-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M  This flag configures G1GC to allocate it's garbage collection blocks in units of 32megs. The reason for this is that chunk data is typically just over eight megabytes in size, and if you leave it default of sixteen megabytes, it'll treat all the chunk data as \"humungous\" and so it'll have to be garbage collected specially as a result. This will especially help in modded causes as some mods tend to cause humongous allocations as well, such as JourneyMap.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"minecraft/troubleshooting/performance/#client-video-settings","title":"Client Video Settings","text":"<p>For clients, regardless of whether or not they are modded, the following video settings are recommended to be configured using the values below as a baseline:</p> Video Setting Description Recommended Setting Chunk Builder Determines which chunk sections are updated synchronously during a single frame.
